= Twilio Usage Lister

This is a small project, written in PHP, that lists a Twilio account's usage details.
Specifically, it supports the ability to list account usage for SMS, MMS, and voice calls within a given date range, filtered by the pre-defined usage categories (daily, monthly, today, yesterday, etc).

You can do all of this by running the commands below.

[source,bash]

When completed, a binary named _twilio-usage-reporter_ will be available in the vendor directory.
